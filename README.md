# Retail-Store-Discounts
The Retail Store Discounts question
On a retail website, the following discounts apply:

If the user is an employee of the store, he gets a 30% discount
If the user is an affiliate of the store, he gets a 10% discount
If the user has been a customer for over 2 years, he gets a 5% discount.
For every $100 on the bill, there would be a $ 5 discount (e.g. for $ 990, you get $ 45 as a discount).
The percentage based discounts do not apply on groceries.
A user can get only one of the percentage based discounts on a bill.
Write a Spring Boot Java application with test cases, which exposes an API such that given a bill, it finds the net payable amount. Please note the stress is on object oriented approach and test coverage. User interface is not required, only an API exposed. What we care about:

object oriented programming approach, provide a high level UML class diagram of all the key classes in your solution. This can either be on paper or using a CASE tool

unit test and code coverage
code to be generic and simple leverage today's best coding practices clear README.md that explains how the code and the test can be run and how the coverage reports can be generated state what you will use to document your API, with an example sample request and response
